   <p1 style="font-family: times; font-size: x-large ; text-align: left; color: honeydew;" div style=position:absolute;>Briefly about me:</p>

   <br>
   <br>

   <p2 style="font-family: arial; font-size: large; color: blueviolet;" > I am a 35 years old student of web development, who has just started the long journey. In general, I am very interested in virtually anything, that has something to do with Science and Tech. So I believe, getting familiar with computers is a good start, since we'd became kinda dependent on them, either in everyday life or in Science... And since I am sort of addicted to browsing the web, why not learning web develpoment at first, in order to become a bit familar with the way computers "speak"...? <br><br> My other interests are travelling ( I have travelled and lived in a bunch of different countries ) , learning about different cultures etc. ... <br><br> I am also passionate about social and enviornmental issues. </p2>
